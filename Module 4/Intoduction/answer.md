# Web Application Basics

## Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend is the part of the website that users can see and use.

- It shows the **user interface** like buttons, forms, images, and text.
- It handles **user actions** such as clicking a button, filling a form, or submitting data.
- It sends requests to the backend and shows the data received from the backend.
- Frontend is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend is the part of the application that works behind the scenes.

- It processes requests sent by the frontend.
- It handles **database operations** like storing, updating, and fetching data.
- It manages **security**, user login, authentication, and authorization.
- Backend makes sure the application works correctly.

## Q3. Business Logic

Business Logic means the **rules of how an application should work** according to business requirements.

It decides what should happen when a user performs an action.

### Examples
1. In an **e-commerce app**, applying discounts and checking product stock.
2. In a **banking app**, checking balance before money transfer.
3. In a **food delivery app**, calculating delivery charges and delivery time.

## Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server Model is a way of communication between a user and a server.

- **Client**: The user’s browser or app that sends requests.
- **Server**: The system that processes requests and sends responses.
- Communication happens using the **internet** and protocols like HTTP.

## Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

3-Tier Architecture divides an application into three layers.

- It shows data to the user and takes input.

### Application (Business) Layer
- Contains business logic.
- Processes user requests.

### Data Layer
- Stores and manages data in databases.

### Why it is used
- Easy to manage and update.
- Better security.
- Makes the application scalable.

## Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is used as a backend language because:

- It is fast and handles multiple requests.
- The same language can be used for frontend and backend.
- It has many frameworks like **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **NestJS**.
- It has a large developer community.
