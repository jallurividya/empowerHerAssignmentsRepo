# Responsive Personal Portfolio (HTML + CSS)

**Candidate:** Vidya Jalluri 
**Repo contents:** `index.html`, `style.css`, `README.md`

## Objective
Responsive personal portfolio page built using **only HTML + CSS** (no frameworks). Includes Header, Hero, Skills, Contact and Footer sections. Works across Desktop / Tablet / Mobile with a CSS-only hamburger menu and no horizontal scroll.

## AI Tool Used (required)
**Lovable.dev** — I used Lovable.dev to quickly generate an initial HTML/CSS scaffold (header, hero layout, and basic structure).

## What I changed / edited manually
After scaffolding from the AI tool, I **manually**:
- Reworked the responsive grid rules to meet the assignment breakpoints (desktop ≥1024px, tablet 768–1023px, mobile ≤767px).
- Implemented a CSS-only hamburger menu using a hidden checkbox and label.
- Created a skills grid with 8 skills and responsive behavior (4-col desktop, 2-col tablet, 1-col mobile).
- Added subtle CSS animations (floating profile card and button hover).
- Fixed spacing, colors, and improved accessibility (semantic HTML, aria-label for nav toggle, meaningful link text).
- Ensured there is **no horizontal scroll** at any breakpoint.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required).
3. Test on different viewport widths or use browser devtools to view Desktop/Tablet/Mobile.

## Bonus features implemented
- CSS-only subtle animation on the profile card.
- Unique color theme (soft indigo + mint).
- Card hover effects for skills and profile card.

## Submission
- Replaced placeholder links (social/email) with my real links before submission.
- Included screenshots of desktop/tablet/mobile in the repo.
